1. The App component will have 4 main state variable
    a. moves
    b. score
    c. current time

2. restart button component to reset every variable and randomize the sequence of the puzzle pieces

3. 4x4 puzzle pieces with one prop (the image) and 2 state variable (display(show or hide), start_timer(true or false)). after the interval the puzzle will switch to hide if they not match or showed other wise
4. I will first layout main component with timer working
5. then I will create the puzzle board component with its child puzzle pieces component.
